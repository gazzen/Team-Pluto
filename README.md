# Retrospectives

## Feb 15, 2023 Retrospective

Lead by : Danyal
Notes by : Shavin

The github repo is not effective, the current setup will cause issues when merging into a single main branch in the future
- currently, there is a single repo and README, that everyone is editing and updating, on individual branch
- will need to restructure to account for future merging
- create a main README that will act as the team meeting 
- create individual work folders that wewill place our individual work into
- place README in each folder, which will be individual notes
- create branches off of main and only put our work in OUR folder
- protect the github main branch from being modified

The KANBAN Trello board is not being used, feature tracking is not available
- will need to identify features to add to the board
