## Work

Today in class we worked through some git exercises, and
created our own git repo for team pluto. My personal goals  are to conduct more research, and get ready to write some simple js scripts
within logic x.

This is the first article I read on the subject: https://www.soundonsound.com/techniques/logic-writing-midi-scripts?amp
It walks a person who is assumed to have little to no experience with javescript (quite impressively!), and explains how
these principles can be applied to the logic x scripter plugin.
There is a bit of a learning curve, but a lot of it just seems to be the renaming of things i already have experience with.
My intention is not to make something specific, rather, it is to experiment and have some fun.
I've also amassed a list of other reading (and the actual logic documentation), and some youtube links to watch.

## Standup

Najib was scrum master, and Andrew took notes.

Daynal - brainstorming and come up with chess traking idea.
Shavin - Researching what p[latform he want to use. Leaning towards Spotify.
Najib - researching, deciding if wants to track multiple sports or just one.
Gajendra - working on wire framing and researching on OTP web app developing
Andrew - searching for docs and articles re js in logic x. Reach out to some friends who know a little about it.
I just need to get my hnds in it, and see how it works.

I'm still not coding... This week, I tossed some ideas around with a friend and fellow musician who also codes, and we just marvelled
at the possibilities. He gave me some ideas about mapping synth parameters. The idea was put out there that you could have an interface for a user. 
Right now, for starters I see myself writing some scripts and integrating a random function into them, in order to create
some auto generated results. Be cool to have a loop which randomly changes.
There is a way to hone the js into certain parameters of a synth, and this is ultimately very interesting to me.
I can imagine applying some sort of randomized scripts to the parameters on these filters. I watched a bit of a youtube video on the basics:

## Standup

- scrum master standup Gajendra
- Shavin took notes
- personal goals are to start coding.
- discussed idea with a senior dev last week, Avi Granite, and he
gave me some ideas for where to start
- reorganizing git folder system - individual folders in main, so when we all merge we wont have conflicts.
will keep individual notes, but keep a common stand-up log.

## Work

I actually sat down, opened logic, and opend the scripting plugin. As per a youtube video i glanced at, I dumped a midi drum track into
the track and prepared to start wrting a script to manipulate it. Didnt get far, but this is where i will pick up from next time.
Planning to get that random function in there quickly, and see what kind of results it generates. 
I'll probably get out of the land of drums quickly, and work with synths, which is what i really want to focus on.
The idea of an interactive element is perculating. This whim of an idea may end up being something I use for a capstone project.
anxious to workk on it, while at the same time very busy with assignments. Be nice to have had more class time to work with.

Here's a screenshot of the project I started:

## Feb 15, 2023 Retrospective

The github repo is not effective, the current setup will cause issues when merging into a single main branch in the future

currently, there is a single repo and README, that everyone is editing and updating, on individual branch
will need to restructure to account for future merging
create a main README that will act as the team meeting
create individual work folders that wewill place our individual work into
place README in each folder, which will be individual notes
create branches off of main and only put our work in OUR folder
protect the github main branch from being modified
The KANBAN Trello board is not being used, feature tracking is not available

will need to identify features to add to the board

## Standup

- Scrum master Danyal
- Gajendra took notes.
- Watched a youtube vid getting started coding. figured out how to engage the plugin.
- brainstorm new ideas with mousepad as interactive tool, not sure if ill get there for this project
but im going to look into it more.
